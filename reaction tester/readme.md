## Inspiration
Inspired by Rob.

## What it does
It is a fun game to test your reaction.

## How we built it
HTML5 CSS JS

## Challenges we ran into
Random color generator: In this game, when you click on the shapes it disappear and appear again with different shape and different color. Getting different shapes is easy, but getting different color every time is kinda difficult.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
It's really a fun to see your reaction. :)

## What we learned
If you stuck, then how do you brainstorm to get the desire result.
